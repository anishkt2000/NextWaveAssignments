## System Overview

The Financial Record Processor is a serverless application designed to handle sensitive financial transaction data. It performs the following key functions:

1. Data validation
2. Anonymization of sensitive information
3. Data enrichment
4. Risk assessment
5. Encryption of processed data
6. Secure storage of encrypted data
7. Retrieval of processed transactions

The system is built using TypeScript and JavaScript, designed to run on AWS Lambda, with API Gateway handling HTTP requests.

## Services

The system consists of the following main services:

1. **Anonymization Service**: Removes or hashes personally identifiable information.
2. **Data Enrichment Service**: Enhances transaction data with additional information.
3. **Encryption Service**: Secures the processed transaction data.
4. **Risk Assessment Service**: Evaluates the risk level of each transaction.
5. **Storage Service**: Handles the storage and retrieval of encrypted transaction data.

For detailed service documentation, refer to `docs/Services.md`.
